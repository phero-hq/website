title: "Integrating Phero with React"
---

As you might know, Phero takes your TypeScript on the backend and generates a type-safe client for your frontend. If you're new to this, be sure to check out the [introduction page](/docs/introduction) to find out more. If you already know this, keep reading.

In a way, there's nothing special about the `PheroClient`. Once initialized, it gives you a set of functions that return promises. To take a deep-dive into how this works, check out [Using the client](/docs/using-phero/using-the-client). For explaining how to integrate the client with React, we'll assume you know the basics.

Let's start with the server, where we've got the following Phero-file:

```ts
import { createService } from "@phero/client"

async function sayHello(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `Hi there, ${name}!`
}

export const messageService = createService({ sayHello })
```

This will allow us to initialise and use the client like so:

```ts
import { PheroClient } from "./phero.generated"

const fetch = window.fetch.bind(this) // or any fetch-lib you want
const phero = new PheroClient(fetch)
const hello = await phero.messageService.sayHello("John")
```

The great thing is, `phero.messageService.sayHello` is nothing more than a function returning a `Promise`. This means you can use it in the way you would use any local function.

To use an `async` function inside of your component, you've got a lot of different options. To get you started, we've explained a couple of those below. But remember: It doesn't matter to Phero, there're regular functions like any other.

## useEffect

One way of fetching async data is by using `useEffect`:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react"

const phero = new PheroClient(window.fetch.bind(this))

function Component() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState<string>()
  const [error, setError] = useState<unknown>()

  useEffect(() => {
    phero.messageService.sayHello()
      .then(setMessage)
      .catch(setError)
  }, [])

  if (error)
    return <p>Something went wrong</p>
  } else if (!message) {
    return <p>Loading message...</p>
  } else {
    return <p>{message}</p>
  }
}
```

## SWR

Another way is to use [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app), and give it our function as the fetcher:

```tsx
import useSWR from 'swr'

const phero = new PheroClient(window.fetch.bind(this))

function Component() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('message', () =>
    phero.messageService.sayHello("John")
  )

  if (error)
    return <p>Something went wrong</p>
  } else if (!data) {
    return <p>Loading message...</p>
  } else {
    return <p>{data}</p>
    //         ^^^^ The type of this is `string`, because `sayHello` returns a `Promise<string>`
  }
}
```

We recommend defining an object to keep track of your cache-keys and keep it type-safe:

```ts
const key = {
  message: "message",
  user: (id: string) => ["user", id],
}

function Component() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR(key.message, phero.messageService.sayHello)
  // ...
}
```

## TanStack Query

You could also go with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/?from=reactQueryV3&original=https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/), and give it our function as the second parameter:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const phero = new PheroClient(window.fetch.bind(this))

function Component() {
  const { data, isError, isLoading } = useQuery(["message"], () =>
    phero.helloWorldService.helloWorld("Sarah"),
  )

  if (isError)
    return <p>Something went wrong</p>
  } else if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading message...</p>
  } else {
    return <p>{data}</p>
    //         ^^^^ The type of this is `string`, because `sayHello` returns a `Promise<string>`
  }
}
```

We recommend defining an object to keep track of your cache-keys and keep it type-safe:

```ts
const key = {
  message: ["message"],
  user: (id: string) => ["user", id],
}

function Component() {
  const query = useQuery(key.message, phero.messageService.sayHello)
  // ...
}
```
